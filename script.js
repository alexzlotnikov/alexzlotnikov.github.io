function sendNotification() {
    // You can use different methods to send notifications, but for simplicity, we'll use an alert.
    alert('Leezah misses you!');

    // You can add code here to send a notification to your phone using a third-party service.
    // For example, you can use services like Pushbullet, Pushover, or Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
